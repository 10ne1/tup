# GCC on MacOSX is horribly outdated. Tup needs at least 4.5 version from MacPorts.
# And because of this bug http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44981 we need gcc-4.6
# Take into account that if you have 64bits MacOSX you need to install gcc with universal binaries support:
# port upgrade --enforce-variants gcc46 +universal
CC = gcc-mp-4.6
