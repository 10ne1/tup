Files are "dependency objects" - timestamp comparison?

for config files (eg: linux/.config)
 - dependency object compares against version copied during last build
 eg: diff linux/.config build/.config
 each line difference creates a new "dependency object", which may be a dependency for source files

lspci at startup
 - can check against old version of lspci output
 - create new dependency objects - even update .config

when parsing directory structure, allow .config objects to be applied recursively

eg: obj-$(CONFIG_PCI) += pci
pci/dep.tup -- Kernel.CONFIG_PCI

debug mode / release mode
