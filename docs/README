tup - teh updater

tup is always run as 'tup'. Not 'tup FOO=bar' or 'tup -d -f7 -seven=1one1!'. This is because tup does not take arguments - tup settles them:

Dude1: I think Makefiles are the best!
Dude2: <Please wait while loading JVM>
Dude2: <...>
Dude2: <...>
Dude2: <...>
Dude2: <...>
Dude2: Ant is awesome because it's java! Java ftw!
tup: I am the best. This argument is settled.
Dudes1&2: Agreed. Let's be friends.


tup runs in a clean environment. If your environment is not clean when tup runs, it will clean it for you. Mother Nature is totally in love with tup because of this.
