<p>Getting started with tup is easy. Just follow these 6 steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="index.html">Build tup</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure your source files are backed up, like in source control, or something. Tup is able to delete old files automatically, though it tries to prevent you from doing silly things like overwrite your hand-written C files. Still, it would suck if you got boned because tup has a bug or something. Hey, your hard disk can go at anytime, too.</li>
  <li>Go to the top of your source tree and type 'tup init'. This will create a .tup/ directory and stick some files in there. The 'db' file is the database, which holds the entire DAG. The rest of the empty files are just used for locking.</li>
  <li>Write a Tupfile to build things. It's probably easiest to start with a single rule and expand from there. You don't save anything by writing everything up front and trying to get it right the first time.</li>
  <li>Perform a build by running 'tup upd'. You can run this from anywhere in the source tree. This will always update the whole tree. You can't fake out tup by trying to build a part of your program if you run upd in a subdirectory or something. Don't even try. You can't win.</li>
  <li>Now you just edit your source files, Tupfiles, or whatevs and run 'tup upd' when you're done.</li>
</ol>
