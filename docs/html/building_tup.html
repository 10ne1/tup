<p>Once you have tup downloaded, you can try to build it by running the included Makefile. Yes, I realize it is quite hypocritical to build a build-system program with another build-system program. Maybe someday it will bootstrap. For now you can just ignore that fact. There is no configure script, so you just have to hope my C is portable, or let me know where it breaks so it can get fixed.</p>
<p>Assuming it builds, you should have an executable named 'tup', and a library named 'ldpreload.so'. For now I just leave those there and add the tup directory to my PATH by adding a few lines to my .bashrc file. Of course you will have to change this line if your name is not marf.</p>
<pre>
# TODO: Install somewhere real
export PATH=$PATH:/home/marf/tup
</pre>
<p>For those not on the d/l with the lingo, the TODO thing means someday I will fix that. At least, that's how I roll.</p>
