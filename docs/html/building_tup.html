<p>Once you have tup downloaded, you can bootstrap it using the bootstrap.sh script:</p>
<pre>
tup$ sh bootstrap.sh
</pre>
<p>This should build a temporary tup and tup-ldpreload.so in the build/ directory, then use that to re-build itself using the supplied Tupfiles.</p>
<p>Assuming it builds, you should have an executable named <em>tup</em>, and a library named <em>tup-ldpreload.so</em>. For now I just leave those there and add the tup directory to my PATH by adding a few lines to my .bashrc file. Of course you will have to change this line if your name is not marf.</p>
<pre>
# TODO: Install somewhere real
export PATH=$PATH:/home/marf/tup
</pre>
<p>For those not on the d/l with the lingo, the TODO thing means someday I will fix that. At least, that's how I roll.</p>
