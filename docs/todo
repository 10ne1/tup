when restarting monitor - compare file timestamps to the last time the monitor
 shutdown? that way no file changes are missed

can we update a server file (like httpd.c) and restart apache? (eg: like incrontab program)

support for test automation? (eg: when a program is rebuilt, its test are executed, or something)

Change or fix 'silent' command flag '@', since it gets confused as the start of an @-variable mark.

multi-arch - when building a name-list, automatically include files in a separate build/$(ARCH) directory or some such?

import/export vars to file

error cases:
what if:
 /lib/libfoo.a
 gcc bar.c -lfoo -L/usr/lib -L/lib
 now create /usr/lib/libfoo.a
 should the link command execute again? after all, if it *did* execute again, it would pull a different lib.

cross compiling

out of tree build

change progress bar: Only print bar on lowest line, then backspace and print command on its own line?

wrapper work if the program does a chdir?

3 phases - create, update, delete? eg: during update, move things in to a separate graph, then process that graph in reverse in order to delete things in the opposite order. Doesn't really matter for files, but if commands involved ifconfig or route or whatever, it may make sense to undo commands in reverse order.
