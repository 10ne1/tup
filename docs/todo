when restarting monitor - compare file timestamps to the last time the monitor
 shutdown? that way no file changes are missed

can we update a server file (like httpd.c) and restart apache? (eg: like incrontab program)

portability:
 mac osx may have trouble with unlink() inside a flist_foreach()?

support for test automation? (eg: when a program is rebuilt, its test are executed, or something)

  when rebuilding foo.c, should stat foo.h and compare against .tup/objects/foo.h/.name to see if timestamp is different? maybe have a timestamp option (part of the tup configuration) to perform this check, and if out of date add foo.h to modify list as well. That way if foo.h is modified but 'tup touch foo.h' wasn't executed, the build won't be inconsistent.
