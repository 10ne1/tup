can we update a server file (like httpd.c) and restart apache? (eg: like incrontab program)

multi-arch - when building a name-list, automatically include files in a separate build/$(ARCH) directory or some such?

import/export vars to file

FD_CLOEXEC flag on file descriptors?

cross compiling

out of tree build

change progress bar: Only print bar on lowest line, then backspace and print command on its own line?

if we do out of tree build, can we have the monitor kill the updater if a file modification is detected? or restart it?

tup build tup

unlinkat(AT_FDCWD) to do the same thing as unlink() (eg: rm -f foo.o in a badly behaving command should cause foo.o to be re-generated)?

recursive grep kills monitor
 - print message when monitor exits?

will cp -Rp olddir newdir break everything if olddir already has a bunch of stuff compiled in it? - try --seriously-overwrite-outputfiles flag again? I forget why I didn't finish that.

use temporary table instead of moving all commands to delete in parser? Should be easy to time the difference.

instead of doing delete_name_file() for each entry in delete_list, maybe change the sql to do 'delete from link where from_id in (select id from delete_list)' or some such. Would still need to iterate to actually unlink() files, though.

autoupdate doesn't autoupdate when first starting the monitor if files have changed while tup wasn't watching

give user an option to kill an autoupdate updater

.gitignore should be re-generated if removed by user?

syntax: color %flags in output

file: 'tcc' [150 in dir 3] - use dirtree?

ifneq

when you include a generated file, print path relative to command that was executed? eg: foo/bar.c includes ../blah/baz.c, print it out as ../blah/baz.c

% flag for suffix so I can do CFLAGS_%(suffix) and set CFLAGS_S for assembly flags

'tup g' shows too much info when a directory changes?

access(2) support in ldpreload?

command that reads from stdin?

tup show to list the Tupfile as read in the current dir?

read in +/- in order to add/remove worker threads?

rule without a : should be an error?

tup-gcc:
if CONFIG_NON_EXISTENT is used, add it to .tup/db as ~UNSET~?
 - make sure it's culled
 - work if user code does '#define CONFIG_BLAH blah'?
 - namespace CONFIG under @/default, @/newconfig, etc?

autoupdate doesn't do everything in tup_init() - is find_tup_dir() needed? what   about db open?

directly support symlinks in tup? Might make t5037 usable.
 - also t5032 when building in parallel and using the 'ln -sf %f %o' pattern rather than 'rm -f %o; ln -s %f %o'

 Add %1, %2, etc to reference first, second prereq?

 rm -rf of gcc tree put the monitor and database kinda outta whack (had to create gcctest/gcc, then rm -rf gcctest again)
	 - [    2/17   ] gcctest
	 Error: Unable to open directory ID 236376
	 -[    1/2    ] uClibc/include
	 Error: Unknown node 295915 named 'gcc' in create graph.

sqlite style graphs for parser

color a line-continuing backslash so it stands out

debug sql mode

try: -Ifoo -Ibar, where both foo and bar have test.h, then delete foo/test.h - should become a ghost

tup try: ': |> echo foo > %o |> bar', then change the Tupfile to remove the rule and replace bar with a manually created file before doing an update. Does the new manual file stay?

gittup try: generated header becomes a regular file (eg: replace a symlinked header with a regular copy) - does this hose someone who clones gittup?
