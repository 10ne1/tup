can we update a server file (like httpd.c) and restart apache? (eg: like incrontab program)

multi-arch - when building a name-list, automatically include files in a separate build/$(ARCH) directory or some such?

import/export vars to file

error cases:
what if:
 /lib/libfoo.a
 gcc bar.c -lfoo -L/usr/lib -L/lib
 now create /usr/lib/libfoo.a
 should the link command execute again? after all, if it *did* execute again, it would pull a different lib.

cross compiling

out of tree build

change progress bar: Only print bar on lowest line, then backspace and print command on its own line?

if we do out of tree build, can we have the monitor kill the updater if a file modification is detected? or restart it?

have an "include_rules" directive that will include a Rules.tup file in all parent directories? Could be useful for making directory-scoped variables. Also allow doing something like set LINUX_ROOT=. and have it get set to the current directory?

"either it was deleted manually" in parser no longer true?

tup build tup

recursive grep kills monitor

will cp -Rp olddir newdir break everything if olddir already has a bunch of stuff compiled in it? - try --seriously-overwrite-outputfiles flag again? I forget why I didn't finish that.

symlink to non-existant file
symlinks pointing at each other

if create_name_file() is always in a (tupid < 0) block because we did a select, maybe bypass the node_select() that happens in tup_db_create_node_part()?
 - also if create_name_file() is always creating a new node, it should always put dt in the create list?

 tup_db_select_node shouldn't return -1 on error and a successful node-doesn't-exist? - maybe get rid of in favor of select_dbn
