when restarting monitor - compare file timestamps to the last time the monitor
 shutdown? that way no file changes are missed

can we update a server file (like httpd.c) and restart apache? (eg: like incrontab program)

support for test automation? (eg: when a program is rebuilt, its test are executed, or something)

Change or fix 'silent' command flag '@', since it gets confused as the start of an @-variable mark.

multi-arch - when building a name-list, automatically include files in a separate build/$(ARCH) directory or some such?

import/export vars to file

error cases:
what if:
 /lib/libfoo.a
 gcc bar.c -lfoo -L/usr/lib -L/lib
 now create /usr/lib/libfoo.a
 should the link command execute again? after all, if it *did* execute again, it would pull a different lib.

cross compiling

out of tree build

change progress bar: Only print bar on lowest line, then backspace and print command on its own line?

wrapper work if the program does a chdir?

html:
  proof: big-o notation
  proof: no clean target
  when Tupfiles are parsed
  how files are deleted
  how dependencies are described/discovered
  tup bugs: build in state Q, change A->B, build in state R, change B->A, build must go back to state Q (not some other state S)
  man pages: tup command line, tup_api
  explicitly named order-only prerequisites don't get a warning when they don't exist? eg: A.java | B.class |> blah... B.java |> ... |> B.class doesn't work, but swapping the order does. In the first case it would be nice to get a warning saying B.class doesn't exist as an object, rather than waiting to run the command to get a missing input dependency error.
