# These suppressions remove the errors that helgrind prints related to the
# main thread calling fuse_exit() while the fuse thread is running. All
# that fuse_exit() does is set a variable to 1, and since this is internal
# to the fuse library we can't add a lock. If fuse is moved out to a separate
# process, this suppression file can go away.
